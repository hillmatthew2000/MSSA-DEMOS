# Array-Based Stack Implementation Instructions

1. Create an **array-based stack** class that manages integer elements and supports standard stack operations.

2. Include a constructor that takes the maximum size of the stack and initializes an internal array.

3. Initialize a variable to track the top of the stack in the constructor.

4. Implement a method to **push** an element onto the stack.

5. Check for stack overflow in the push method.

6. Implement a method to **pop** the top element from the stack.

7. Check for stack underflow in the pop method.

8. Implement a method to **peek** to view the top element without removing it.

9. Create a Main method to demonstrate the stack functionality.

10. In the Main method, instantiate the stack with a size of 5.

11. **Push the values 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 in order**.

12. Display the stack contents from top to bottom.

13. Perform a **pop** operation.

14. Perform a **peek** operation.

15. Perform another **pop** operation.

16. Display the updated stack contents again.

17. Ensure that your implementation correctly updates the top index and handles overflow and underflow conditions.
