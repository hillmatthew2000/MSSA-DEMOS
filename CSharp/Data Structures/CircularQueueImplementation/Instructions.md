# Circular Queue Implementation Instructions

1. Create an **array-based circular queue** class that maintains **FIFO order** and allows efficient insertion and deletion without shifting elements.

2. Include a constructor that accepts the maximum size of the queue and initializes an internal array along with **front** and **rear** pointers.

3. Implement methods to **enqueue** elements at the rear, wrapping around to the beginning of the array when necessary.

4. Implement methods to **dequeue** elements from the front.

5. Handle underflow and overflow conditions appropriately in both enqueue and dequeue operations.

6. Include a method to display all elements currently in the queue in order from front to rear.

7. Create a Main method to demonstrate the queue functionality.

8. In the Main method, **enqueue the values 10, 20, 30, and 40**.

9. Display the queue contents after enqueuing all values.

10. Perform a **dequeue** operation.

11. Display the updated queue contents to illustrate how the circular structure works.
