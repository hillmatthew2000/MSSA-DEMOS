# Array-Based Deque Implementation Instructions

1. Create an **array-based double-ended queue (Deque)** class that allows integer elements to be inserted and removed from both ends.

2. Include a constructor that accepts the maximum size of the deque and initializes an internal array.

3. Initialize variables to track the **front** and **rear** positions in the constructor.

4. Implement a method to **insert at the front** of the deque.

5. Implement a method to **insert at the rear** of the deque.

6. Implement a method to **delete from the front** of the deque.

7. Implement a method to **delete from the rear** of the deque.

8. Handle underflow and overflow conditions appropriately in all insertion and deletion methods.

9. Use modulo arithmetic to allow the deque to wrap around the array when the front or rear reaches the end.

10. Maintain a circular structure throughout all operations.

11. Create a Main method to demonstrate the deque functionality.

12. In the Main method, **insert the values 10 and 20 at the rear**.

13. **Insert the value 5 at the front**.

14. Display the deque contents after the initial insertions.

15. Delete one element from the front.

16. Display the deque contents after the front deletion.

17. Delete one element from the rear.

18. Display the deque contents after the rear deletion.

19. Ensure the display shows how elements are added and removed from both ends throughout all operations.
